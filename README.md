### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eric Burden. I'm a bit of a polyglot, who focuses on finding and using the right tool for the job to promote the best possible real-world impact through the use of technology. I'm most comfortable working on data analytics projects, but I'm happy to dive in anywhere from web frontends to data pipelines to CLI applications. My top talent is the ability to quickly learn and be productive in new languages and tools.

#### :octocat: Notable repos ...

- [ericwburden/trainr](https://github.com/ericwburden/trainr): An R package that provides a local, interactive R learning experience for end-users, with integrations into RStudio and straightforward extensibility.
- [ericwburden/trainrUI](https://github.com/ericwburden/trainrUI): A minimal deployment of a web-based (Shiny) user interface for accessing the `trainr` package from above. Deploys with Docker Swarm and runs R code in a separate `plumber` API-based container. A running demo can be found here: [https://trainr.dev](https://trainr.dev).
- [ericwburden/django-compose-app](https://github.com/ericwburden/django-compose-app): A Django app deployed using Docker Swarm. A branch of this application (dtd_requests_app) was deployed to support a call center to connect individuals to services in the Memphis, TN area during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Another branch (keepcount) was proposed as an MVP for using websockets to maintain a distributed occupancy counter.
- [ericwburden/advent_of_code_2020](https://github.com/ericwburden/advent_of_code_2020): Solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles for 2020 in R and Rust.
- [ericwburden/advent_of_code_2021](https://github.com/ericwburden/advent_of_code_2021): Solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles for 2021 in Julia. Arguably a *much* better project setup than I had in 2020.
- [ericwburden/ericburden_work](https://github.com/ericwburden/ericburden_work): The repository for my personal site, written using [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).
- [ericwburden/rustbind](https://github.com/ericwburden/rustbind): Demonstration project for using Rust as a low-level implementation language in an R package.
- [ericwburden/tictacterminal](https://github.com/ericwburden/tictacterminal): Cross-platform, terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game I made on a whim.
- [codeconnector/CodingDojo](https://github.com/codeconnector/CodingDojo): Repository for a meetup that I host (with the other admins) to help provide up-and-coming developers with an opportunity to pair-program in public, in preparation for technical interviews.


#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

Learning Elm. I'm a big fan of the strongly-typed, functional-style paradigm (and I don't love JavaScript/TypeScript). Elm seems very promising for quickly developing MVPs of web applications, and I'm particularly interested in what an Elm frontend on a Rust [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/) would look like in terms of speed, security, and usability.

#### ðŸ’¬ I love to talk about ...

How we use technology to serve people, especially in domains where advancement and adoption of technology has lagged behind the private sector. There are TONS of opportunities out there to improve people's lives using existing technology and practices.
